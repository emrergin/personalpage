### What I learned
- The fact that *I am pretty cool*.
- This the first website I cared about localization. Since there are only 2 languages, did not try to use any external remedies, like [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/).

### Thanks
- Some design tips from [Eren Alkış](https://www.youtube.com/erenalkis).
