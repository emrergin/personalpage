### What I learned
- The fact that *I am pretty cool*.
- This the first website I cared about localization. Since there are only 2 languages, did not try to use any external remedies, like [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/).
- *CSS* `aspect-ratio` and `overflow` properties have different interactions in Firefox and Chrome.
- This is the first website I focused more on grids rather than flexboxes.

### Thanks
